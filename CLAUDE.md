# agent - Personal Command Line Agent

Agent is a highly autonomous AI command line agent.

Note on Interaction with the User:
The user is using MacOS native speech recognition. It is not great quality. So the input often ends up sounding similar to what I mean, but being written like something else. I hope you can interpret what is being said beyond the noise.
