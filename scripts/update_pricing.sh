./run.sh "please consume https://invertedstone.com/calculators/openai-pricing and give me a python dict that's a mapping from ai model name to its price per token. The model name should be like openai:gpt-4.1-mini - all lowercase, separated by dashes, each model is prefixed with openai:. When you have the result, please write it to the file at static/pricing.py. Overwrite that file with this new dict. The keys to the dict are the model name with prefix as previously stated, the value should be another dict with one key input, which contains the input pricing, and another key output, which contains the output pricing. Don't write a script to do it, just create the dict yourself by distilling the information on the page."
